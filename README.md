# My First GitHub Repository

This repository contains the code I pushed to GitHub for the first time using the `git push` command.
Also, I have included a `.gitignore` file to exclude certain files and directories from git version control.

## Contents

- `GitTest1.cpp`: This file contains the main code of the project.(just a test file)
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LABYRINTH3/GitTest.git
    ```

2. Run the code using your preferred method.
